Chorlton Water Park,4,June,2016," Lovely amble around the Mersey valley yesterday (Friday 3rd June), Kenworthy-Chorlton WP-Mersey-Chorlton Ees-Sale WP and back the same way. Over fifty species seen or heard, the highlights were:- Reed Warbler - showing well at Chorlton and Sale Sedge Warbler - singing and showing well on Chorlton Ees Swifts, Swallows, House and Sand Martins - eye level views along the Mersey Kingfisher - perched on flotsam around a storm drain for c5 mins near disused bridge Grey Wagtail - lovely male, same place as Kingfisher Buzzard - 3 birds over Chorlton Ees area interacting Sparrowhawk - male soaring over golf course near Jackson's Boat Kestrel - female hunting over fields behind Broad Ees Dole Little Grebe - lovely views of 3 adults Broad Ees Dole Jackdaw - mob of c20 watched at close quarters in paddock, Hardy's farm area Greenfinch - several on Barlow tip including a smart male wheezing! Lots of Blackcaps, Whitethroats and Chiffchaffs, 1 Willow Warbler Stock Dove - 3 of this attractive and underrated bird, 1 of which showed well on the river bank Reed Bunting - nice male with a beak full of insects Chorlton Ees on return leg Willow Tit - working the tree line at the edge of Chorlton Ees Bullfinch - nice male near Willenhall Lane exit of Kenworthy Wood ",Stock Dove,3
Chorlton Water Park,13,May,2016," I used to do the same Liam, always hoped for an Osprey following the R.Mersey but always to no avail, but got Stock Doves ",Stock Dove,X
Chorlton Water Park,11,May,2016," Just to add to the Stock Dove discussion, I've been birding the site on and off for the last 10 years and have been giving it a good go this year for Patchwork Challenge (Although sadly not for a couple of weeks). I record Stock Dove pretty regularly on Barlow Tip, often as flyovers but have flushed them from the deck, and have had them over Kenworthy too. I've had them on 4 separate occasions this year so far and according to Birdtrack have recorded them on 22% of my visits. They seem to be a pretty common bird in the Mersey Valley in general so hopefully you should catch up with one on patch soon Tim! ",Stock Dove,10
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Never kept a site list, it's all in old notebooks like we used to do! With full descriptions of stuff I found (inc crappy drawings!) & got accepted like Ferruginous Duck, Ring-necked Duck, Red-crested Pochard & the like! In the halcyon days when the aythya flock was over 1000 regularly. Never got Ring-necked Parakeet though!! Nor Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, but did have the Firecrest there one year. I never in all my walks had a Lesser Whitethroat though, even when birding mates such as Kevin McCabe & good birders like him joined me, so you did really well to get those the other day, but the habitat is perfect now for them & back in the day wasn't as good. The patch (I always have a defined patch rather than do sites) was from my house too (in West Didsbury) and had Ring Ouzel on it (got piccies!) and Wheatear was regular every year. How times have changed! As Joel says for him & Liam, for Shannon earlier this year & for my group today, we all saw Stock Dove over Barlow Tip, so that seems your best bet I'd say Plenty of Bullfinches about today too, that was always a feature when I was there though, so that's still good ",Stock Dove,1000
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016,"PM me your site list Paul! I've had Stock Dove close to home on the Fallowfield Loop but Chorlton WP would be good. Missing Raven too but I do have Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (twice!) ",Stock Dove,X
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016,"I have done it many times and came back to my bike with it being ok, I was just unlucky but when I do go back I will be on foot. Tim I have had stock doves several times when I was with Liam, I've seen them from kenworthy and Barlow tip. I would recommend just spending 15-20 minutes stood there sky watching. ",Stock Dove,15
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," I know, I have seen them over in the past but as a patcher prob only got them about five times a year (I was unemployed so walked the site every day!), got at least half the group onto them and my wife (a very good birder) saw them too, so IDed by at least 3 good birders. Had them throughout the Mersey Valley before, Tim, my last GM Bird Report that I have, before I left the County, was 1999 (the year I moved to Cheshire) and included in the Stock Dove summary were 20 at Chorlton Ees, just along the river from Barlow Tip!! Hopefully you'll get it on your site list soon, just go every day, worked for me (I was unemployed & did Chorlton WP daily!!) ",Stock Dove,3
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016,"Stock Dove is an excellent bird and would be a site tick for me ",Stock Dove,X
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Sorry to hear that Joel, I will add my comments on this later with relevant info from today! I had organised a bird ID walk for a Manchester University group today at Newchurch Common but given the awful waether in Cheshire we decided to switch venues from my new patch back to my old patch from when I lived in West Didsbury in the 1990s! We had fine weather for the whole session and with 8 students, 1 PhD student and 2 lecturers attending we had a great walk. Bird song was concentrated on as a few of them had visual ID skills but had had no practise on calls/song. Highlights included a Common Sandpiper from the bridge over the R.Mersey from the Water Park to Kenworthy Fields and on that stretch of the river at least 4 different Grey Wagtails. One Reed Warbler sang its little head off and gave stunning views allowing close approach and folk ended up with superb photos even just using phones! Warblers seen and heard included Common Whitethroat, Blackcap, Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler. At least 10 Swifts were seen but only one Swallow. Two Stock Doves flew over us on Barlow Tip as did a Buzzard. A group of 5 Ring-necked Parakeets were over the pond area and singles were seen in 4-5 other areas, part of the group or extra birds, hard to tell! Broods of Mallard and Canada Geese were seen and the 6 Mute Swan cygnets performed beautifully for the group, clambering onto mums back giving great phot opportunities at the very end of our session, a great way to end with mega-cuteness! All in all a very succesful trip with a great group, really eager to learn, hopefully I'll get a chance to take many of them to my new patch in the future An aside for Joel, one of the students came on his bike & I told him of your experience. He decided to risk it and returned to his locked bike with no problems at all, nothing removed and all intact. I appreciate your warnings as I could pass this on, but today showed that it will not always happen, but personally I wouldn't risk it either. ",Stock Dove,1990

A week ago there were three Sparrowhawks wheeling overhead, very high but making a fair bit of noise. One of the three kept taking a poke at the second while the third looked on.

A single independent juvenile Great Spotted Woodpecker was seen and a male Blackcap was feeding at least 1 begging, wing-shivering juvenile. Also Little Grebe, Stock Dove, Nuthatch, Grey Heron and Goldcrest. About 150 Canada Geese around the lake. It was nice to see good numbers of House Sparrows and Starlings around the areas of housing.

Fletcher Moss Park,4,December,2016," I had a nice walk around the woods 11.00-13.00 with my niece Grace, who is nine. In between prodding mud and icy puddles with sticks we saw 4 Teal, a Nuthatch, a Ring-necked Parakeet, a Grey Heron, a Great Tit, a Kestrel being chased by a Crow and a few Magpies. I also noticed a Treecreeper, Jay and Great Spotted Woodpecker but these were a bit less obvious for her to see. Some brilliant fungi in there too. Despite being typically busy with 'normals', birds were showing well and in bright sunshine it was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,11
Fletcher Moss Park,6,April,2016,"I have seen less Great Spotted Woodpeckers in Stenner Woods this year than in both the last 2, and also nearby in the wood by Priestnall Fields in Heaton Mersey, where last year there was at least a pair. Both areas are occupied by Ring-necked Parakeets. They are not scientific studies by any means but I didn't think the Great Spotted Woodpecker was in decline, so where are they? As a kind of control, I have seen less than usual near my office in Wythenshawe, so maybe it is all a coincidence. Last year and the year before there were at least 3 pairs within half a mile of my office in 3 separate little woods, and this year I've only seen 1 pair. Again not scientific but of some anecdotal value perhaps? ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,2

Highlights were up to 8 Ring-necked Parakeets, at least two of them 'singing' territorially from trees which they left but kept returning to to carry on repetitively 'singing'. I only checked out the eastern end of the lake but still picked up 3(2 drake) Goosanders and a female Goldeneye amongst the commoner waterfowl. Plenty of Tufted Ducks and a pair of Gadwall too as well as a female Pochard. A Great Spotted Woodpecker was calling on Kenworthy Fields and a few Redwings were flying about.

Perhaps their territories are not too scattered and they reside in the centre of our golf course. We have regular pheasants, jays, herons and long tailed tits, and 3 or 4 buzzards circling is not uncommon. Your kingfisher pays an occasional visit to one of our streams.

It was in the trees running alongside the athletic stadium, the Great spotted woodpecker was drilling for a second then moving on to another tree and it kept doing this. Unfortunately I could not get a picture. within the same area there was a female Nuthatch but she quickly gave me the slip. I enjoyed a good 1.5 hours wandering around the park seeing nesting Blue Tits, busy Coal Tits and some very fast Long-tailed Tits, numerous Woodpigeons and a couple of Collared Doves and of course many friendly grey Squirrels. Sparrows were chirping at each other. A couple of Robins came and kept me company until they got bored, It was most enjoyable. ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,1

The photo does not show the bird's green secondaries, which distinguish it from the female Mallard, who's secondaries are blue. Speaking to somebody who knew the petting zoo which used to be part of Fog Lane very well, this kind of duck was not kept at the petting zoo. So it's likely to have come from another collection. Strange! Otherwise, I have noted the usual birds in Fog Lane this week. A large flock of Redwings is still here; Great spotted woodpeckers, Nuthatches, a Goldcrest and of course the Parakeets.

Heaton Mersey Common,17,December,2016,"I was too lazy to head out anywhere very far today, so I went for an enjoyable mooch around the small NR this afternoon. 28 species, which I was happy with as it is generally pretty quiet there. I also heard some Pink-footed Geese flying over and a Siskin which I couldn't locate. 2 Great Spotted Woodpecker were showing well, one in fact was seen at around 10m range feeding on the base of a tree by the water's edge. It got flushed by a Moorhen at one point; not seen that before! My best views of this species for a long time. ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,28

Later in the visit some were resting in the tall trees and giving a subdued version of the incessant communal chatter/song that I heard from Redwing flocks at this site and also at Alexandra Park in March '09. The song today was not as loud as that from March last year - I presume the volume of song might grow in strength as the birds approach their departure date? 2 Fieldfare amongst the Redwings. 2 Cormorants, a pair of Nuthatch and a single Goldcrest were also seen. 1 drumming Great Spotted Woodpecker, 3 singing Song Thrush and 1 singing Mistle Thrush.

Birchfields Park,11,May,2016," I pass through this park often and I've been consistently surprised by what can be found so deep into the city! With a bit of patience a fair number of woodland species can be seen. I've been visiting for about two years, and I'm usually able to see the common assemblage of tits, blackbirds, robins, wrens, woodpigeons etc... It is a hotspot for Ring-necked Parakeet. After dark, I once caught a Tawny owl. Nuthatch, Great spotted woodpecker, Song thrush , Mallard, Goldfinch and Jay are fairly regular and I tend to see at least a few on each visit. I've seen Treecreeper once, on the long avenue of trees near the bridge. I've caught Blackcap in the vegetation at the northern extent of the river this and last year. Bullfinch have been spotted twice, both times in the wooded corner near the church; last week I was privileged to watch a pair foraging just 5 metres from me for a good 5 minutes. Grey wagtails are occasionally on the river. I've never spotted House Sparrow within the park itself, but a short way down the wooded cycle path which leaves the south entrance of the park is a house where they roost and can always be heard. This is always a nice spot to wander and is the most accessible place from Fallowfield and Rusholme to see a range of woodland species. ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,5

This happened on 2 occasions. 2 fledged Magpies were seen and 2 Cormorants flew over. 3 Goldcrest were singing in different areas and all four tit species had family parties of begging young - including Coal Tit.

Exciting possibilities! The garden list has started well. I am training her to birdwatch! Just put my name down on the Audenshaw waiting list too but I'm told it's 'dead-man's-shoes' now.

Boggart Hole,8,November,2012,"c350 Jackdaw in the tall trees surrounding the lake at around 4.00 pm today and birds still arriving in small numbers as I left. The majority of birds (but not all) including flocks of up to c50 birds in size appeared to be coming into Boggart from a south-easterly direction. Possibly a pre-roost gathering?...as I have an earlier record of Jackdaws assembling here late in the day on 29th December 2010, when birds were seen departing north-west 15 minutes before darkness, presumably to roost elsewhere. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to stay 'till nearer darkness today. So possibly this site is a suitable interim meeting up point before they continue in the same direction, heading towards their night time roost? One wonders how far some of these birds must travel each day between the feeding locations and their safe sleeping quarters? Still it was a really nice visual and aural treat late this afternoon.

Almost on the final whistle of the Derby I got a text off Ian and Tony Darby and myself raced back on our bikes to join Tony O Mahony.

It flew from Holly trees across Desmene Road into a Willow on the corner of Spring Bridge Road. It eventually flew back into the park to what may be the favoured Holly Trees and showed well at no more than 10 feet range.

Alexandra Park,9,December,2012,"You all must have arrived just seconds after Tony Darby and myself left after two hours searching having been tipped off by Tony O'Mahony. The main tit flock of 20 odd Long-tailed Tits, 15 or so Blue Tits, 2 Coal Tits, 2 Coal Tits and 2 Great Tits with 2 Goldcrests was a little further East around the lodge. We went back around the boating lake twice (where 3 more Goldcrests seemingly resident in tall firs) but missed out and left getting cold. Almost on the final whistle of the Derby I got a text off Ian and Tony Darby and myself raced back on our bikes to join Tony O Mahony. As the light faded tantalising probables flitted around the tall pines by the private blocks of flats on Greysham Court off Demesne Road. We heard them call very close by but no view for a positive ID ",Great Tit,20
Alexandra Park,9,December,2012,"A brief search round the boating lake Holly trees and Mark thought he heard a call, so we lingered. Great Tit, Blue Tit, Coal Tit, Robin, and Goldcrest slowly revealed themselves. Hope was fading with the light but in the nick of time a Firecrest showed briefly at first, then well. It flew from Holly trees across Desmene Road into a Willow on the corner of Spring Bridge Road. It eventually flew back into the park to what may be the favoured Holly Trees and showed well at no more than 10 feet range. Amazingly it was then joined by a second bird, the two being only 1 foot apart on the same branch. ",Great Tit,10

In between prodding mud and icy puddles with sticks we saw 4 Teal, a Nuthatch, a Ring-necked Parakeet, a Grey Heron, a Great Tit, a Kestrel being chased by a Crow and a few Magpies. I also noticed a Treecreeper, Jay and Great Spotted Woodpecker but these were a bit less obvious for her to see. Some brilliant fungi in there too.

He said he had seen it 3 times but only brief views and that was over 20 mins ago. Halso gave us directions and off we went in search of him. At 4:30 we decided that that we were going to leave after hearing him 4 times but not seeing him. On our way out I was looking in the hedges when my Godmother said 'Joel I have just seen something pinky fly past but it is probaly a bullfinch"" I went to have a look where it had landed and was rewarded with a stunning view of a male redstart sitting 2 meters away in a hawthorn. I got some photos and deiced we would leave but on our way out he kept on following us so I got some more photos. In the end we decided we would leave once and for all but we met up with another birder (who I am really sorry have forgotten the name of). We were told him he had missed it by 2 min and decided to show him where it was at the moment seen as we were going that way. Just as we were showing him it flew into a tree and then into the path giving amazing view. All together a really nice day out. We also saw: 2 m +2 f whitethroats, 5 m + 3 f blackcaps with more heard, 17 chiffchaff, 6 willow warblers with 2 nests, 1 male reed bunting in the brambles at the bottom of grouper hill, 2 song thrushs and the usual ( long-tailed tits, great tits, etc) ",Great Tit,3

Birchfields Park,11,May,2016," I pass through this park often and I've been consistently surprised by what can be found so deep into the city! With a bit of patience a fair number of woodland species can be seen. I've been visiting for about two years, and I'm usually able to see the common assemblage of tits, blackbirds, robins, wrens, woodpigeons etc... It is a hotspot for Ring-necked Parakeet. After dark, I once caught a Tawny owl. Nuthatch, Great spotted woodpecker, Song thrush , Mallard, Goldfinch and Jay are fairly regular and I tend to see at least a few on each visit. I've seen Treecreeper once, on the long avenue of trees near the bridge. I've caught Blackcap in the vegetation at the northern extent of the river this and last year. Bullfinch have been spotted twice, both times in the wooded corner near the church; last week I was privileged to watch a pair foraging just 5 metres from me for a good 5 minutes. Grey wagtails are occasionally on the river. I've never spotted House Sparrow within the park itself, but a short way down the wooded cycle path which leaves the south entrance of the park is a house where they roost and can always be heard. This is always a nice spot to wander and is the most accessible place from Fallowfield and Rusholme to see a range of woodland species. ",Tawny Owl,5

Fletcher Moss Park,4,December,2016," I had a nice walk around the woods 11.00-13.00 with my niece Grace, who is nine. In between prodding mud and icy puddles with sticks we saw 4 Teal, a Nuthatch, a Ring-necked Parakeet, a Grey Heron, a Great Tit, a Kestrel being chased by a Crow and a few Magpies. I also noticed a Treecreeper, Jay and Great Spotted Woodpecker but these were a bit less obvious for her to see. Some brilliant fungi in there too. Despite being typically busy with 'normals', birds were showing well and in bright sunshine it was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. ",Ring-necked Parakeet,11
Fletcher Moss Park,6,April,2016," Good discussion this one, I wasn't trying to suggest that there was direct competition for nest-holes, my point was more about the way the Ring-necked Parakeets occupy the area by the Boardwalk and whether they could 'dominate' a territory in the first place. My supposition was that if a Woodpecker wasn't comfortable in the area it wouldn't get as far as excavating a hole, in favour of moving somewhere else. I think I've read that this can occur between Great and Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers, correct me if I'm wrong of course. ",Ring-necked Parakeet,X
Fletcher Moss Park,6,April,2016," I agree Tim (again!). A study done in Dorset on Ring-necked Parakeets showed the greatest impact was on Jackdaw tree hole nesting, as the species compete directly for older pre-excavated holes. Of course Jackdaws do nest elsewhere (chimneys etc) so not a total disaster for them ",Ring-necked Parakeet,X

I only checked out the eastern end of the lake but still picked up 3(2 drake) Goosanders and a female Goldeneye amongst the commoner waterfowl. Plenty of Tufted Ducks and a pair of Gadwall too as well as a female Pochard. A Great Spotted Woodpecker was calling on Kenworthy Fields and a few Redwings were flying about.

Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Never kept a site list, it's all in old notebooks like we used to do! With full descriptions of stuff I found (inc crappy drawings!) & got accepted like Ferruginous Duck, Ring-necked Duck, Red-crested Pochard & the like! In the halcyon days when the aythya flock was over 1000 regularly. Never got Ring-necked Parakeet though!! Nor Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, but did have the Firecrest there one year. I never in all my walks had a Lesser Whitethroat though, even when birding mates such as Kevin McCabe & good birders like him joined me, so you did really well to get those the other day, but the habitat is perfect now for them & back in the day wasn't as good. The patch (I always have a defined patch rather than do sites) was from my house too (in West Didsbury) and had Ring Ouzel on it (got piccies!) and Wheatear was regular every year. How times have changed! As Joel says for him & Liam, for Shannon earlier this year & for my group today, we all saw Stock Dove over Barlow Tip, so that seems your best bet I'd say Plenty of Bullfinches about today too, that was always a feature when I was there though, so that's still good ",Ring-necked Parakeet,1000
Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Sorry to hear that Joel, I will add my comments on this later with relevant info from today! I had organised a bird ID walk for a Manchester University group today at Newchurch Common but given the awful waether in Cheshire we decided to switch venues from my new patch back to my old patch from when I lived in West Didsbury in the 1990s! We had fine weather for the whole session and with 8 students, 1 PhD student and 2 lecturers attending we had a great walk. Bird song was concentrated on as a few of them had visual ID skills but had had no practise on calls/song. Highlights included a Common Sandpiper from the bridge over the R.Mersey from the Water Park to Kenworthy Fields and on that stretch of the river at least 4 different Grey Wagtails. One Reed Warbler sang its little head off and gave stunning views allowing close approach and folk ended up with superb photos even just using phones! Warblers seen and heard included Common Whitethroat, Blackcap, Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler. At least 10 Swifts were seen but only one Swallow. Two Stock Doves flew over us on Barlow Tip as did a Buzzard. A group of 5 Ring-necked Parakeets were over the pond area and singles were seen in 4-5 other areas, part of the group or extra birds, hard to tell! Broods of Mallard and Canada Geese were seen and the 6 Mute Swan cygnets performed beautifully for the group, clambering onto mums back giving great phot opportunities at the very end of our session, a great way to end with mega-cuteness! All in all a very succesful trip with a great group, really eager to learn, hopefully I'll get a chance to take many of them to my new patch in the future An aside for Joel, one of the students came on his bike & I told him of your experience. He decided to risk it and returned to his locked bike with no problems at all, nothing removed and all intact. I appreciate your warnings as I could pass this on, but today showed that it will not always happen, but personally I wouldn't risk it either. ",Ring-necked Parakeet,1990

The Reed Warblers are definitely present, watched both flitting about for 30 mins around 7 am, I think they keep their heads down once it gets as busy as it was today! Otherwise pretty much what Steve said, lots of Whitethroats, Blackcaps and Chiffchaffs. There was A Garden Warbler singing from deep cover about 50m downstream of the bridge at Jackson's Boat but I couldn't see it, try as I might. Also of relevance, 1 Willow Tit in trees adjacent to the slipway about 30m past Broad Ees Dole. 1 lapwing and 6 Little Grebes on said reserve.

Birchfields Park,11,May,2016," I pass through this park often and I've been consistently surprised by what can be found so deep into the city! With a bit of patience a fair number of woodland species can be seen. I've been visiting for about two years, and I'm usually able to see the common assemblage of tits, blackbirds, robins, wrens, woodpigeons etc... It is a hotspot for Ring-necked Parakeet. After dark, I once caught a Tawny owl. Nuthatch, Great spotted woodpecker, Song thrush , Mallard, Goldfinch and Jay are fairly regular and I tend to see at least a few on each visit. I've seen Treecreeper once, on the long avenue of trees near the bridge. I've caught Blackcap in the vegetation at the northern extent of the river this and last year. Bullfinch have been spotted twice, both times in the wooded corner near the church; last week I was privileged to watch a pair foraging just 5 metres from me for a good 5 minutes. Grey wagtails are occasionally on the river. I've never spotted House Sparrow within the park itself, but a short way down the wooded cycle path which leaves the south entrance of the park is a house where they roost and can always be heard. This is always a nice spot to wander and is the most accessible place from Fallowfield and Rusholme to see a range of woodland species. ",Ring-necked Parakeet,5
