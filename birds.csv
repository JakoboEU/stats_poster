Chorlton Water Park,11,May,2016," Just to add to the Stock Dove discussion, I've been birding the site on and off for the last 10 years and have been giving it a good go this year for Patchwork Challenge (Although sadly not for a couple of weeks). I record Stock Dove pretty regularly on Barlow Tip, often as flyovers but have flushed them from the deck, and have had them over Kenworthy too. I've had them on 4 separate occasions this year so far and according to Birdtrack have recorded them on 22% of my visits. They seem to be a pretty common bird in the Mersey Valley in general so hopefully you should catch up with one on patch soon Tim!

Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Never kept a site list, it's all in old notebooks like we used to do! With full descriptions of stuff I found (inc crappy drawings!) & got accepted like Ferruginous Duck, Ring-necked Duck, Red-crested Pochard & the like! In the halcyon days when the aythya flock was over 1000 regularly. Never got Ring-necked Parakeet though!! Nor Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, but did have the Firecrest there one year. I never in all my walks had a Lesser Whitethroat though, even when birding mates such as Kevin McCabe & good birders like him joined me, so you did really well to get those the other day, but the habitat is perfect now for them & back in the day wasn't as good. The patch (I always have a defined patch rather than do sites) was from my house too (in West Didsbury) and had Ring Ouzel on it (got piccies!) and Wheatear was regular every year. How times have changed! As Joel says for him & Liam, for Shannon earlier this year & for my group today, we all saw Stock Dove over Barlow Tip, so that seems your best bet I'd say Plenty of Bullfinches about today too, that was always a feature when I was there though, so that's still good ",Stock Dove,X,"p today, we all saw Stock Dove over Barlow Tip, so",https://manchesterbirding.activeboard.com/t8967729/chorlton-wp/?ts=1483643272&direction=next&page=3&sort=newestFirst#comment-62120418

Had them throughout the Mersey Valley before, Tim, my last GM Bird Report that I have, before I left the County, was 1999 (the year I moved to Cheshire) and included in the Stock Dove summary were 20 at Chorlton Ees, just along the river from Barlow Tip!!

Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Sorry to hear that Joel, I will add my comments on this later with relevant info from today! I had organised a bird ID walk for a Manchester University group today at Newchurch Common but given the awful waether in Cheshire we decided to switch venues from my new patch back to my old patch from when I lived in West Didsbury in the 1990s! We had fine weather for the whole session and with 8 students, 1 PhD student and 2 lecturers attending we had a great walk. Bird song was concentrated on as a few of them had visual ID skills but had had no practise on calls/song. Highlights included a Common Sandpiper from the bridge over the R.Mersey from the Water Park to Kenworthy Fields and on that stretch of the river at least 4 different Grey Wagtails. One Reed Warbler sang its little head off and gave stunning views allowing close approach and folk ended up with superb photos even just using phones! Warblers seen and heard included Common Whitethroat, Blackcap, Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler. At least 10 Swifts were seen but only one Swallow. Two Stock Doves flew over us on Barlow Tip as did a Buzzard. A group of 5 Ring-necked Parakeets were over the pond area and singles were seen in 4-5 other areas, part of the group or extra birds, hard to tell! Broods of Mallard and Canada Geese were seen and the 6 Mute Swan cygnets performed beautifully for the group, clambering onto mums back giving great phot opportunities at the very end of our session, a great way to end with mega-cuteness! All in all a very succesful trip with a great group, really eager to learn, hopefully I'll get a chance to take many of them to my new patch in the future An aside for Joel, one of the students came on his bike & I told him of your experience. He decided to risk it and returned to his locked bike with no problems at all, nothing removed and all intact. I appreciate your warnings as I could pass this on, but today showed that it will not always happen, but personally I wouldn't risk it either. ",Stock Dove,2,ly one Swallow.

A week ago there were three Sparrowhawks wheeling overhead, very high but making a fair bit of noise. One of the three kept taking a poke at the second while the third looked on.

Chorlton Water Park,16,February,2017," As I had an emergency dental appointment in West Didsbury today I combined it with a visit to my old local patch and have a lovely, shortish, visit in the bright sunshine. Highlights were up to 8 Ring-necked Parakeets, at least two of them 'singing' territorially from trees which they left but kept returning to to carry on repetitively 'singing'. I only checked out the eastern end of the lake but still picked up 3(2 drake) Goosanders and a female Goldeneye amongst the commoner waterfowl. Plenty of Tufted Ducks and a pair of Gadwall too as well as a female Pochard. A Great Spotted Woodpecker was calling on Kenworthy Fields and a few Redwings were flying about. At least 5 Nuthatches were seen, several visiting the feeding station. Great to be back and a bonus to make up for my pain ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,1,a female Pochard.

Chorlton Water Park,30,May,2012," As a regular golfer at Chorlton Golf Club, I am surprised that the Water Park postings rarely record Great Spotted Woodpeckers. Every time I play I see 3 or 4 of them, and often in the trees where we are adjacent to Chorlton Water Park. Perhaps their territories are not too scattered and they reside in the centre of our golf course. We have regular pheasants, jays, herons and long tailed tits, and 3 or 4 buzzards circling is not uncommon. Your kingfisher pays an occasional visit to one of our streams.

Longford Park,18,May,2016," I was in longford park yesterday afternoon and I left the car park heading into the park when I heard a Woodpecker. It was in the trees running alongside the athletic stadium, the Great spotted woodpecker was drilling for a second then moving on to another tree and it kept doing this. Unfortunately I could not get a picture. within the same area there was a female Nuthatch but she quickly gave me the slip. I enjoyed a good 1.5 hours wandering around the park seeing nesting Blue Tits, busy Coal Tits and some very fast Long-tailed Tits, numerous Woodpigeons and a couple of Collared Doves and of course many friendly grey Squirrels. Sparrows were chirping at each other. A couple of Robins came and kept me company until they got bored, It was most enjoyable.

Fog Lane Park,18,March,2018," Over the past few months I've noticed an unusual duck on Fog Lane pond. I'm certain it is an Indian Spot-billed Duck. I'm aware this sounds far-fetched so I've attached a photo. I see I'm not the first to identify this duck here either. The photo does not show the bird's green secondaries, which distinguish it from the female Mallard, who's secondaries are blue. Speaking to somebody who knew the petting zoo which used to be part of Fog Lane very well, this kind of duck was not kept at the petting zoo. So it's likely to have come from another collection. Strange! Otherwise, I have noted the usual birds in Fog Lane this week. A large flock of Redwings is still here; Great spotted woodpeckers, Nuthatches, a Goldcrest and of course the Parakeets.

Birchfields Park,11,May,2016," I pass through this park often and I've been consistently surprised by what can be found so deep into the city! With a bit of patience a fair number of woodland species can be seen. I've been visiting for about two years, and I'm usually able to see the common assemblage of tits, blackbirds, robins, wrens, woodpigeons etc... It is a hotspot for Ring-necked Parakeet. After dark, I once caught a Tawny owl. Nuthatch, Great spotted woodpecker, Song thrush , Mallard, Goldfinch and Jay are fairly regular and I tend to see at least a few on each visit. I've seen Treecreeper once, on the long avenue of trees near the bridge. I've caught Blackcap in the vegetation at the northern extent of the river this and last year. Bullfinch have been spotted twice, both times in the wooded corner near the church; last week I was privileged to watch a pair foraging just 5 metres from me for a good 5 minutes. Grey wagtails are occasionally on the river. I've never spotted House Sparrow within the park itself, but a short way down the wooded cycle path which leaves the south entrance of the park is a house where they roost and can always be heard. This is always a nice spot to wander and is the most accessible place from Fallowfield and Rusholme to see a range of woodland species. ",Great Spotted Woodpecker,1,"awny owl.

It seemed to have the ploy of getting quite close to the adult Blackbird, which then seemed to get a bit nervous and lose its ""bottle"" and drop the food it was carrying, which the juvenile Mistle Thrush then picked up! This happened on 2 occasions. 2 fledged Magpies were seen and 2 Cormorants flew over. 3 Goldcrest were singing in different areas and all four tit species had family parties of begging young - including Coal Tit.

Exciting possibilities! The garden list has started well. I am training her to birdwatch! Just put my name down on the Audenshaw waiting list too but I'm told it's 'dead-man's-shoes' now.

Exciting possibilities! The garden list has started well. I am training her to birdwatch! Just put my name down on the Audenshaw waiting list too but I'm told it's 'dead-man's-shoes' now.

Boggart Hole,8,November,2012,"c350 Jackdaw in the tall trees surrounding the lake at around 4.00 pm today and birds still arriving in small numbers as I left. The majority of birds (but not all) including flocks of up to c50 birds in size appeared to be coming into Boggart from a south-easterly direction. Possibly a pre-roost gathering?...as I have an earlier record of Jackdaws assembling here late in the day on 29th December 2010, when birds were seen departing north-west 15 minutes before darkness, presumably to roost elsewhere. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to stay 'till nearer darkness today. So possibly this site is a suitable interim meeting up point before they continue in the same direction, heading towards their night time roost? One wonders how far some of these birds must travel each day between the feeding locations and their safe sleeping quarters? Still it was a really nice visual and aural treat late this afternoon.

Longford Park,18,May,2016," I was in longford park yesterday afternoon and I left the car park heading into the park when I heard a Woodpecker. It was in the trees running alongside the athletic stadium, the Great spotted woodpecker was drilling for a second then moving on to another tree and it kept doing this. Unfortunately I could not get a picture. within the same area there was a female Nuthatch but she quickly gave me the slip. I enjoyed a good 1.5 hours wandering around the park seeing nesting Blue Tits, busy Coal Tits and some very fast Long-tailed Tits, numerous Woodpigeons and a couple of Collared Doves and of course many friendly grey Squirrels. Sparrows were chirping at each other. A couple of Robins came and kept me company until they got bored, It was most enjoyable.

Great Tit, Blue Tit, Coal Tit, Robin, and Goldcrest slowly revealed themselves. Hope was fading with the light but in the nick of time a Firecrest showed briefly at first, then well. It flew from Holly trees across Desmene Road into a Willow on the corner of Spring Bridge Road. It eventually flew back into the park to what may be the favoured Holly Trees and showed well at no more than 10 feet range. Amazingly it was then joined by a second bird, the two being only 1 foot apart on the same branch. ",Great Tit,X,"ll, so we lingered.

Chorlton Water Park,27,April,2015,"I got there around 3 and on the way over to the woods I ask a birder (who we later found out was Pete Hines) if he had seen it and where it was. He said he had seen it 3 times but only brief views and that was over 20 mins ago. Halso gave us directions and off we went in search of him. At 4:30 we decided that that we were going to leave after hearing him 4 times but not seeing him. On our way out I was looking in the hedges when my Godmother said 'Joel I have just seen something pinky fly past but it is probaly a bullfinch"" I went to have a look where it had landed and was rewarded with a stunning view of a male redstart sitting 2 meters away in a hawthorn. I got some photos and deiced we would leave but on our way out he kept on following us so I got some more photos. In the end we decided we would leave once and for all but we met up with another birder (who I am really sorry have forgotten the name of). We were told him he had missed it by 2 min and decided to show him where it was at the moment seen as we were going that way. Just as we were showing him it flew into a tree and then into the path giving amazing view. All together a really nice day out. We also saw: 2 m +2 f whitethroats, 5 m + 3 f blackcaps with more heard, 17 chiffchaff, 6 willow warblers with 2 nests, 1 male reed bunting in the brambles at the bottom of grouper hill, 2 song thrushs and the usual ( long-tailed tits, great tits, etc) ",Great Tit,X,"( long-tailed tits, great tits, etc) ",https://manchesterbirding.activeboard.com/t8967729/chorlton-wp/?ts=1454523065&direction=next&page=5&sort=newestFirst#comment-60098939

Birchfields Park,11,May,2016," I pass through this park often and I've been consistently surprised by what can be found so deep into the city! With a bit of patience a fair number of woodland species can be seen. I've been visiting for about two years, and I'm usually able to see the common assemblage of tits, blackbirds, robins, wrens, woodpigeons etc... It is a hotspot for Ring-necked Parakeet. After dark, I once caught a Tawny owl. Nuthatch, Great spotted woodpecker, Song thrush , Mallard, Goldfinch and Jay are fairly regular and I tend to see at least a few on each visit. I've seen Treecreeper once, on the long avenue of trees near the bridge. I've caught Blackcap in the vegetation at the northern extent of the river this and last year. Bullfinch have been spotted twice, both times in the wooded corner near the church; last week I was privileged to watch a pair foraging just 5 metres from me for a good 5 minutes. Grey wagtails are occasionally on the river. I've never spotted House Sparrow within the park itself, but a short way down the wooded cycle path which leaves the south entrance of the park is a house where they roost and can always be heard. This is always a nice spot to wander and is the most accessible place from Fallowfield and Rusholme to see a range of woodland species. ",Tawny Owl,1,"rk, I once caught a Tawny owl.

My supposition was that if a Woodpecker wasn't comfortable in the area it wouldn't get as far as excavating a hole, in favour of moving somewhere else.

Highlights were up to 8 Ring-necked Parakeets, at least two of them 'singing' territorially from trees which they left but kept returning to to carry on repetitively 'singing'. I only checked out the eastern end of the lake but still picked up 3(2 drake) Goosanders and a female Goldeneye amongst the commoner waterfowl. Plenty of Tufted Ducks and a pair of Gadwall too as well as a female Pochard. A Great Spotted Woodpecker was calling on Kenworthy Fields and a few Redwings were flying about.

Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Never kept a site list, it's all in old notebooks like we used to do! With full descriptions of stuff I found (inc crappy drawings!) & got accepted like Ferruginous Duck, Ring-necked Duck, Red-crested Pochard & the like! In the halcyon days when the aythya flock was over 1000 regularly. Never got Ring-necked Parakeet though!! Nor Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, but did have the Firecrest there one year. I never in all my walks had a Lesser Whitethroat though, even when birding mates such as Kevin McCabe & good birders like him joined me, so you did really well to get those the other day, but the habitat is perfect now for them & back in the day wasn't as good. The patch (I always have a defined patch rather than do sites) was from my house too (in West Didsbury) and had Ring Ouzel on it (got piccies!) and Wheatear was regular every year. How times have changed! As Joel says for him & Liam, for Shannon earlier this year & for my group today, we all saw Stock Dove over Barlow Tip, so that seems your best bet I'd say Plenty of Bullfinches about today too, that was always a feature when I was there though, so that's still good ",Ring-necked Parakeet,X,egularly.

Chorlton Water Park,10,May,2016," Sorry to hear that Joel, I will add my comments on this later with relevant info from today! I had organised a bird ID walk for a Manchester University group today at Newchurch Common but given the awful waether in Cheshire we decided to switch venues from my new patch back to my old patch from when I lived in West Didsbury in the 1990s! We had fine weather for the whole session and with 8 students, 1 PhD student and 2 lecturers attending we had a great walk. Bird song was concentrated on as a few of them had visual ID skills but had had no practise on calls/song. Highlights included a Common Sandpiper from the bridge over the R.Mersey from the Water Park to Kenworthy Fields and on that stretch of the river at least 4 different Grey Wagtails. One Reed Warbler sang its little head off and gave stunning views allowing close approach and folk ended up with superb photos even just using phones! Warblers seen and heard included Common Whitethroat, Blackcap, Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler. At least 10 Swifts were seen but only one Swallow. Two Stock Doves flew over us on Barlow Tip as did a Buzzard. A group of 5 Ring-necked Parakeets were over the pond area and singles were seen in 4-5 other areas, part of the group or extra birds, hard to tell! Broods of Mallard and Canada Geese were seen and the 6 Mute Swan cygnets performed beautifully for the group, clambering onto mums back giving great phot opportunities at the very end of our session, a great way to end with mega-cuteness! All in all a very succesful trip with a great group, really eager to learn, hopefully I'll get a chance to take many of them to my new patch in the future An aside for Joel, one of the students came on his bike & I told him of your experience. He decided to risk it and returned to his locked bike with no problems at all, nothing removed and all intact. I appreciate your warnings as I could pass this on, but today showed that it will not always happen, but personally I wouldn't risk it either. ",Ring-necked Parakeet,5,zzard.

The Reed Warblers are definitely present, watched both flitting about for 30 mins around 7 am, I think they keep their heads down once it gets as busy as it was today! Otherwise pretty much what Steve said, lots of Whitethroats, Blackcaps and Chiffchaffs. There was A Garden Warbler singing from deep cover about 50m downstream of the bridge at Jackson's Boat but I couldn't see it, try as I might. Also of relevance, 1 Willow Tit in trees adjacent to the slipway about 30m past Broad Ees Dole. 1 lapwing and 6 Little Grebes on said reserve.

Birchfields Park,11,May,2016," I pass through this park often and I've been consistently surprised by what can be found so deep into the city! With a bit of patience a fair number of woodland species can be seen. I've been visiting for about two years, and I'm usually able to see the common assemblage of tits, blackbirds, robins, wrens, woodpigeons etc... It is a hotspot for Ring-necked Parakeet. After dark, I once caught a Tawny owl. Nuthatch, Great spotted woodpecker, Song thrush , Mallard, Goldfinch and Jay are fairly regular and I tend to see at least a few on each visit. I've seen Treecreeper once, on the long avenue of trees near the bridge. I've caught Blackcap in the vegetation at the northern extent of the river this and last year. Bullfinch have been spotted twice, both times in the wooded corner near the church; last week I was privileged to watch a pair foraging just 5 metres from me for a good 5 minutes. Grey wagtails are occasionally on the river. I've never spotted House Sparrow within the park itself, but a short way down the wooded cycle path which leaves the south entrance of the park is a house where they roost and can always be heard. This is always a nice spot to wander and is the most accessible place from Fallowfield and Rusholme to see a range of woodland species.
